# Setting Up a Python Environment
To learn Python we're going to use a browser based tool called the *Jupyter Notebook*. Jupyter allows you to type Python code and see the output all in the same place. It also has lots of in-built functions to make it easier for you to learn and use Python. In other words, it's the ideal tool for learning Python.

We'll be downloading Jupyter, as well as a number of other useful data science tools and libraries, from a website called [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) which provides an environment (also called Anaconda) for accessing various data science tools. These are the steps to go through to get up and running with Anaconda and the Jupyter Notebook.

Please note that the instructions below only apply if you are using a macOS or Windows computer. If you are using ChromeOS or iOS refer to [these instructions](SETUP-ENV-ALT.md).

## Step 1: Visit the Anaconda Website

To download Anaconda for your operating system visit https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and select the `Download` button. You'll see these choices.

## Step 2: Select Your Operating System

Choose your operating system. If you use Windows or MacOS I suggest you use the `64-Bit Graphical Installer`. This will download the installation file which you must open. On a Mac it looks like this when you open the downloaded file.

## Step 3: Install Anaconda

Follow the instructions to install Anaconda. You can accept all of the defaults after agreeing the license terms. 

## Step 4: Open Anaconda Navigator

Once you have installed Anaconda you need to open the Anaconda Navigator from wherever it was installed. You should then see a screen like this.

## Step 5: Launch the Jupyter Notebook

From the Anaconda Navigator you can launch the Jupyter Notebook by clicking on the `Launch` button for that application. The Jupyter Notebook will open in a new browser window. **Make sure you launch Jupyter Notebook and not JupyterLab**.
