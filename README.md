# Introduction to Python for Data Analysis
This is my short (1 day course) on learning Python for data analysis.

It includes a crash course in Python itself as well as how to use some of the main Python libraries for performing data analysis.

- [Setting Up a Python Environment](SETUP-ENV.md)
- [Python Crash Course Part I](PART-I.md)
- [Python Crash Course Part II](PART-II.md)
- [Python Crash Course Part III](PART-III.md)
- [Using Pandas](Pandas.md)

For a list of resources I have found useful for learning [Python](https://www.python.org) see [Learning Python Resources](RESOURCES.md).

These two are particularly good as a source of reference:
- [Learn Python Programming](https://pythonbasics.org). This site contains reference material and exercises for the Python 3 programming language and many of the major Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy etc).
- [W3 Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). Learn by example as well as with exercises and reference material.
