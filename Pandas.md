# Using Pandas

Welcome to the *Using Pandas* part of the Python crash course. All of the code for this section can be found in the  [Pandas Series Notebook](Pandas-Series.ipynb) and [Pandas DataFrames Notebook](Pandas-DataFrames.ipynb). Open these notebooks in Jupyter and try running each of the cells making sure you understand exactly what is going on.

In this tutorial we cover:
- Importing Pandas
- Pandas Series
- Pandas DataFrames (including basic visualisation)
- Importing Data into Pandas DataFrames

You're now ready to move to the next part of this module, [Data Visualisation with Matplotlib](Matplotlib.md).
