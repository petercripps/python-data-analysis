# Setting Up a Python Environment in ChromeOS or iOS
If you are not using a macOS or Windows computer you cannot use Anaconda however there are alternates. See below for help on running Jupyter and Python in different environments.

## How to Run Jupyter in ChromeOS
The blog post [Data Science on a Chromebook: How to run Jupyter, Python, and R locally in ChromeOS](https://alex.miller.im/posts/data-science-chromebook-pixelbook-jupyter-python-r/) by Alex P. Miller provides a step-by-step guide to getting Jupyter up and running locally in the Linux container on your Chromebook. Please note I have not followed these instructions (I don't have a Chromebook).

## How to Run Jupyter in iOS
**Carnets Jupyter** is a standalone implementation of of Jupyter notebooks. Everything runs on your iPad or iPhone using an umbedded Python interpreter (no need for an internet connection). Go to the App store on youyr device and search for `Carnets Jupyter`.

Alternatively [Juno](https://juno.sh) is a complete Jupyter development environment for your iPad or iPhone. You can run Python code and use industry-standard desktop tools on your iOS device, such as SciPy, Scikit-learn and Pandas. However Juno is a paid for app from the App store (current price Â£14.99).
