# Learning Python Resources
This is a list of resources I found useful for learning [Python](https://www.python.org).

I've also added links to a few other resources which, whilst not directly Python related, will be useful whilst putting together a Python program using a web frontend and for managing code etc.

You can find some Python code examples built during my learning [here](code).

## Tools
### Python
Before you can do anything with Python you need to install it. Python is cross-platform (i.e. can run on macOS, Windows, Linux and Docker) and you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Python Extension for Visual Studio Code
In order to do anything practical with Python you'll need an Integrated Development Environment with extensions that support the language. A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VSC) extension with rich support for the Python language (for all actively supported versions of the language: 2.7, >= 3.5), including features such as IntelliSense, linting, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, Jupyter notebook support, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, snippets, and more! The VSC extension for Python can be downloaded from within VSC or from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

Once you have VSC and the Python extension installed you can test everthing works by building a `Hello World` program following [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).

### Jupyter Project
[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html) is a non-profit, open-source project, born out of the IPython Project in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages. The Jupyter Notebook sits between the command line and code editors like Visual Studio Code (VSC) allowing you to develop fragments of code for testing. 

If you use pip, you can install Jupyter with:

`pip install notebook`

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

`jupyter notebook`

See [Running the Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running) for more details.

### The HTML Handbook
[This handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-html-handbook/) on HTML is aimed at two types of audience. First, the beginner. I explain HTML from zero in a succinct but comprehensive way, so you can use this book to learn HTML from the basics. Then, the professional. HTML is often considered like a secondary thing to learn. It might be taken for granted. Yet lots of things are obscure to many people. This handbook aids a basic understanding of the topic. Even if you don't write HTML in your day to day work, knowing how HTML works can help save you some headaches when you need to understand it from time to time, for example while tweaking a web page.
